horriblestats
=============

Born out of the need to cross tabulate available user demographics (from a database CSV export) with user actions (from a different CSV export). 

Potentially useful if anybody else ever needs to cross tab info from two CSVs and has access only to Ruby 1.8.7 (which lacks faster CSV and competent CSV writing) and Sublime text with no ability to install any gems or update Ruby or gain direct access to the db. Hopefully, that will never be anybody else. 

Should anybody ever actually find this I highly recommend avoiding it at all costs. 

God help this project.
